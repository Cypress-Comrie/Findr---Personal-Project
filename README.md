# Boilerplate: React with Express and Vite

This is a starter project that uses Vite to bundle a React app and Express to serve it in production. Express is used in development to serve an API server.

Vite React App: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
Express API Server: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Requests to `http://localhost:5173/api` are proxied to `http://localhost:3000/api`.

## Setup

### Installation

#### **From the Github UI**
