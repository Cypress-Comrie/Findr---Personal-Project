# Welcome to my Personal project! CodeNamed Findr
## The Big Plan  
I have had this Idea for a while i originally came up with the base of it for a group project which we did implement. we made an activity chooser app using the bored api.
i really liked the idea of the "tinder like" theme swipping right for yes and left for no.

The idea for Findr is a couples based app where you can find movies to watch together instead of spending hours deciding and looking you can open up findr throughout the day swipe a couple of times and have a match by the time you's are ready to watch.

* Im thinking we need to create a relationship through accounts where you both swipe on a list of randomized movies when you swipe (right) yes it adds it to a personalised watchlist 
and if your partner also swipes yes on the same movie it takes it to a combined watchlist.

* I want the user to be able to refine their search down to what theyre looking for so Ill add a catagories selector and a date range selector 
 
* have buttons that take you to a personalised watchlist aswell as to your combined watchlist




## The Road Map


#### **Stretch**
* Have a pop up like tinder when a match is made for a more in your face representation 
* A play button that takes you to a website to view the movie (Not sure on the legalities behind this)

# Boilerplate: React with Express and Vite

This is a starter project that uses Vite to bundle a React app and Express to serve it in production. Express is used in development to serve an API server.

Vite React App: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
Express API Server: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Requests to `http://localhost:5173/api` are proxied to `http://localhost:3000/api`.

## Setup

### Installation

#### **From the Github UI**

See the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) to use Github's feature to create a new repo from a template.

```
git clone [your-project-ssh-address]
cd [your-project-name]
npm install # to install dependencies
npm run dev # to start the dev server
```

You can find the client running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
